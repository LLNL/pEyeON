## Making Contributions

We welcome contributions from the community. To contribute to this project, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. We are using pre-commit hooks to adhere to coding standards. Pre-commit is a part of the optional dependencies--see below on how to install. The hooks will run automatically each time a commit is made. If any hook fails, the issues will need to be fixed before committing again.

All contributions to EyeON are made under the MIT license (MIT).

### For Developers:

1. Create a virtual environment with python >= 3.8 [Optional, but recommended]

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Clone peyeon

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LLNL/pEyeON.git
cd pEyeON
```

3. Install in editable mode
```bash
pip install -e .
```

4. Optional dependencies needed for running pre-commit and building Sphinx documentation: 
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"
```

To check that pre-commit install worked, run
```bash
pre-commit install
